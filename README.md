## About Me
Hi, I'm Emily! I am currently a student working towards a Master's degree in Management Information Systems at the Univeristy of Alabama in Birmingham. I have a non-technical background in Special Education, but have found my passion for data, computers, and programming. A graduate of Auburn University's Data Analytics Bootcamp, I've honed my skills in Python, SQL, Tableau, and Excel. 

Committed to continuous growth, I've earned the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and a Udemy SQL certificate. I've also taken college-level classes in C++, Python, and Linux. My favorite programming language is Python. 

My [portfolio repository](https://github.com/emilygfagan/portfolio) is where you will find all of my projects, certifications, and links to more data projects!
