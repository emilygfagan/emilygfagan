## About Me
Hi, I'm Emily! I am pursuing a Master of Science degree in Management Information Systems with a concentration in Business Analytics. 

I am a former Special Education teacher, and for the last ~6 months I have been learning the ins and outs of all things data analytics in a Data Analytics Bootcamp at Auburn University. I have been self studying, completing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, completing a Udemy SQL certificate, and working on portfolio projects -- all in order to land my first data analyst position. 

My portfolio repository is where you will find all of my projects, certifications, and links to more data projects!
