## About Me
Hi, I'm Emily! I am pursuing a Master of Science degree in Management Information Systems with a Concentration in Business Analytics. 

I am a former Special Education teacher, and for the last ~6 months I have been learning the ins and outs of all things data analytics in a Data Analytics Bootcamp at Auburn University. I have been self studying, completing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, completing a Udemy SQL certificate, and working on portfolio projects -- all in order to land my first data analyst position. 

My portfolio repository is where you will find all of my projects, certifications, links to my other data projects, and more!
