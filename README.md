## About Me
Hi, I'm Emily!
I'm a Master's student in Management Information Systems with a concentration in Cybersecurity at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. With a background in Special Education and customer service, Iâ€™ve transitioned into IT with a strong passion for systems, troubleshooting, and infrastructure.     

I recently earned by CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) certification and have hands-on experience with:
- Active Directory (OU design, user/group management, domain setup)
- Windows and Linux administration
- Command line tools (Bash, PowerShell)
- IT hardware setup and troubleshooting
- SQL (PostgreSQL & MySQL)
- GUI creation and scripting in Python

I also hold an undergraduate certificate in Information Systems (18 credit hours) from UAB where I focused on systems analysis, data management (including hands-on projects with Microsoft Access and C++), information systems, business communications, and emerging IT trends.       

Additionally, I earned a Data Analytics Certificate (12 credit hours) from Auburn University, where I focused on Python, SQL, Tableau, and Excel. I received a 4.00 grade in both certificate programs!     

My [portfolio repository](https://github.com/emilygfagan/portfolio) is where I showcase my IT and systems projects, certifications, and ongoing learning.
