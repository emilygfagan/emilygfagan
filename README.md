## About Me
Hi, I'm Emily! I have a non-technical background in Special Education, but have found my passion for data analytics. A graduate of Auburn University's Data Analytics Bootcamp, I've honed my skills in Python, SQL, Tableau, and Excel. 

Committed to continuous growth, I've earned the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and a Udemy SQL certificate.

My favorite programming language is Python. I am currently enrolled in an introductory Python course at Southern Union State Community College and am working on expanding my Python portfolio with new projects involving web scraping and e-commerce data.

My [portfolio repository](https://github.com/emilygfagan/portfolio) is where you will find all of my projects, certifications, and links to more data projects!
