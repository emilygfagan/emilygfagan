## About Me
Hi, I'm Emily!
I'm a Master's student in Management Information Systems with a concentration in Cybersecurity at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. With a background in Special Education, I’ve transitioned into IT with a strong passion for systems, troubleshooting, and infrastructure.
I’m currently studying for the CompTIA A+ certification and have hands-on experience with:
- Active Directory (OU design, user/group management, domain setup)
- Windows and Linux administration
- Command line tools (Bash, PowerShell)
- IT hardware setup and troubleshooting
- SQL (PostgreSQL & MySQL)
- GUI creation and scripting in Python

My coursework includes systems analysis, data management (including hands-on projects with Microsoft Access and C++), information systems, business communications, and emerging IT trends. I also completed Auburn University’s Data Analytics Bootcamp, where I focused on Python, SQL, Tableau, and Excel.

My [portfolio repository](https://github.com/emilygfagan/portfolio) is where I showcase my IT and systems projects, certifications, and ongoing learning.
